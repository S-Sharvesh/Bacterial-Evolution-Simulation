# Bacterial-Evolution-Simulation
Bacterial Evolution Simulation models the behavior and evolution of bacteria under pressure and temperature constraints. Users define initial conditions, and bacteria consume food, reproduce, and adapt over generations. The simulation visualizes population growth and evolving resistances using Pygame, with results plotted using Matplotlib.
